# Security Vulnerability Detection with GPT

## Introduction

This repository utilizes the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to assist in finding security vulnerabilities in pull requests (PRs). GPT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that can analyze code and identify potential security issues.

## How it Works

When a PR is submitted or updated, this repository triggers a GPT-powered analysis to scan the code changes and identify security vulnerabilities. It leverages the model's ability to understand and interpret code, looking for common security concerns such as:

- SQL injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Input validation problems
- Insecure coding patterns

The results of this analysis are then reported in the PR discussion, helping reviewers and contributors identify and address potential security flaws.

## Getting Started

To use this security vulnerability detection system, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.

3. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed for running the analysis, such as Python and the required GPT models.

4. Configure the repository and set up webhooks to trigger the analysis on PRs.

5. When a PR is submitted or updated, the GPT analysis will automatically run, and the results will be displayed in the PR discussion.

6. Review the security vulnerabilities reported by GPT and take necessary actions to address them.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance this security vulnerability detection system. Feel free to submit pull requests, open issues, or provide feedback to help us improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the analysis.

## Disclaimer

While GPT can be a valuable tool for identifying security vulnerabilities, it is not a replacement for manual code review and security testing. Always follow best practices for code security and perform thorough security assessments on your projects.
